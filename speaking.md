## 2013

### RubyConf Argentina: Web Linguistics

_27-11-2013 - 28-11-2013, Buenos Aires, Argentina_

Final version of this talk about formal languages, security, and the perils of using strings plus manual escaping.

This is the most conceptual, high level version of this talk I've given. It was also the first time I drew all my slides in Inkscape.

I also did a lightning talk on functional programming in Ruby, this time live coding with some Emacs macros to guide me.

### ArrrrCamp: Functional Patterns for Ruby

_03-10-2013 - 04-10-203, Ghent, Belgium_

Adaptation of the lightning talk I did at JRubyConf. People really liked it, which sparked me to start writing a book on the subject, [The Happy Lambda](https://leanpub.com/happylambda).

I also did a talk at the Rails Girls workshop, titled "Learning to Learn"

### JRubyConf: Functional Patterns for Ruby

_14-08-2013 - 15-08-2013, Berlin, Germany_

A spur of the moment lightning talk, showing some "programming in the small" patterns that I had stumbled upon while working on Hexp, which heavily uses immutability.

### Rulu: Web Linguistics

_20-06-2013 - 21-06-2013, Lyon, France_

First iteration of my "Web Linguistics" talk, which diggs into the combination of formal languages and security. It is a call to stop using strings for structured data, especially data that complies to a formal language, and use data structures, i.e. syntax trees instead.

Of the different versions of this talk this one is the most theoretical.
