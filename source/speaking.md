### JRubyConf.EU: Functional Patterns for Ruby

{:#rulu2013}
### Rulu: Web Linguistics

_20-06-2013 - 21-06-2013, Lyon, France_

First iteration of my "Web Linguistics" talk, which diggs into the combination of formal languages and security. It is a call to stop using strings for structured data, especially data that complies to a formal language, and use data structures, i.e. syntax trees instead.

Of the different versions of this talk this one is the most theoretical.
